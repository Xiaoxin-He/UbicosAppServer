<h2>Proportion Playground Paint Splash</h2>
<h3>Proportion Playground Task Card</h3>
<h4>Paint Splash</h4>
<ol>
  <li>As a group: create a rule using words and an equation using the y=mx format</li>
    <ul> Discuss with your group: <br/>
        <li>What does the x represent in your graph?</li>
        <li>What does the y represent in your graph?</li>
        <li>How is the y= rule related to the blue:yellow ratios from your paint splashes?
            Why does this make sense?</li>
        <li>How could you use your y= rule to find another paint splash that matches the color?
            (Then check a sample in your graph to see if it fits!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Digital</h3>
    <li>  Choose the group number your teacher assigns to you. Do a digital gallery walk to look at
        all the other table/graph/rules of other groups. Do you think they have identified the
        proportion. Can you see how they went from table to graph to rule? Do you see anything that
        doesnâ€™t make sense?
</li>
</ol>
