        If I want to scale up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, Iâ€™m not sure I want to do a physical model with
        blocks for numbers that big. Use the unit rate from yesterday to help write a rule we could use to help us find how much
        paint would be needed without having to make a physical model.

        Does it match with the data we collected. What if I needed 100 cups to paint the whole house? 275?
        Just one cup to paint a doll house?
