<h2>Day  2</h2>

<p>
    For any of these examples, we could create a table with a very consistent and predictable pattern.
    We can see this pattern when we graph these functions.

    Whiteboard the KA example from last night, as well as one other problem.


    Post a picture of your whiteboard to the <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="6" data-view="comment" data-heading="Fruit Punch"
                                        data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery</a>.
    View together as a class.



    What do each of the graphs have in common?
