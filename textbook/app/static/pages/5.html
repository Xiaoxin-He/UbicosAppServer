    I’ve found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint. That makes one batch of <strong>
    Perfect Purple Paint</strong>.

    I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches.
    How much of each color will I need to paint the entire bathroom?

    Let’s make a model using the Unifix Cube blocks to represent the information in this problem. Have one color block represent red paint
    and another color block represent blue paint. Open the
    <a class="video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/">Unifix Tool</a> and
    show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint using this tool.
