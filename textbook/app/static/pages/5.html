<h2>Day  2</h2>

<p>
    Think of an example of a proportional relationship. (Remember we’ve discovered several together already.)
    Come up with as many examples with your group as you can. <br/>


    In the General Chat, share one example of a proportional relationship that is not already there. Add a statement
    to explain how you know. Respond to another student’s explanation with feedback. Is it also a Function? Explain your thinking.
