<h2>Proportion Playground Paint Splash</h2>
<h3>Proportion Playground Task</h3>
<h4>Paint Splash</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Discuss with your group: How are the color: color ratios different for each paint splash? How are they the same?
    </li>

    <li>Discuss with your group: How would you describe the paint splash you created? What kind of rule can describe how
        to make your paint color?
        <a class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="2" data-description="Brainstorm description">Share your responses.</a>
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="2"></a>

</li>
  <li>As a group: create a rule using words and an equation using the y=mx format</li>
    <a href="#" class="table" data-id="3">Table/Graph</a>.
     <a class="activity-button table" data-id="3" ></a> <br/>
    <ul> Discuss with your group: <br/>
        <li>What does the x represent in your graph?</li>
        <li>What does the y represent in your graph?</li>
        <li>How is the y = mx rule related to the blue:yellow ratios from your paint splashes?
            Does this make sense, why or why not?</li>
        <li>How could you use your y = mx rule to find another paint splash that matches the color?
            (Then check a sample in your graph to see if it fits!)</li>
    </ul>
