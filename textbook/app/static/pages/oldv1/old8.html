  <li>Assign roles to each group member in your Google Doc:</li>

        <li>Creation Surveyor</li>
        <li>Desmos Expert</li>
        <li>Recorder</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Create a necklace with some kind of repeating pattern. Once your group agrees on the design,
      the Creation Surveyor should take a screenshot and paste it into your Doc.</li>
  <li>Discuss with your group: How would you describe the pattern you created? The Recorder
      should type your response(s) in complete sentences.</li>
    <li>Each group member should then...</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new, unique necklace (either larger or smaller from all others in your group) with the same
            repeating pattern (except the Creation Surveyor who will use the original necklace). Screenshot your creation & paste into the gallery.
