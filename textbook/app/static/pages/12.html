        Visit the Gallery of other groups to observe their paint splashes, tables, graphs, and rules.
        As a group leave at least one comment. Do you have any questions about what you see? Is there any help you can give to the group?
        Anything you liked or thought was creative?

        Look at the comments other groups made on your board. Do you want to make any changes before your Whiteboard meeting?
        Revisit the Model-So-Far - any changes needed to help us understand a proportion? Anything to take out? Add? Modify?
