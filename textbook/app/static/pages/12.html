<h1>Paint Splash Whiteboard Meeting</h1>

<p>
    Review the comments your group received in the Whiteboard.
    Is there anything you would change on your Whiteboard Tool based on your classmates' feedback?
    What can you change to make your board more clear?

    If you do not yet have a rule on your board, do your best to add one.
    Think about how you would find the number of cups of each color needed for any size room.

    Let's discuss your whiteboards as a class. Keep in mind the suggestions from the badges to ask good questions
    and make productive comments.

    <h4>Refine Your Model</h4>
    We want to make sure we all agree on the terms we are using.
    Are there any words we need to define as a class?
    We can discuss terms using the Vocabulary section of the Model-So-Far page.
