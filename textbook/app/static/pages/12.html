<h2>Activity 1 - How Fast?</h2>
<h3>Lab</h3>
<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Using the materials at hand, your task is to devise a method of determining how fast your car moves as confidently as possible.
        Create your plan on the large whiteboard.
        <!--<a href="#" class="moreinfo" data-id="2">More Information</a>-->
        <!--<a class="activity-button moreinfo" data-id="1" ></a>-->
        <ul>
            <li>What measurements do you need to take?</li>
            <li>What units will you use?</li>
            <li>Do you plan to take more than one set of data?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Take a picture of your directions so you can reference them as you do the experiment.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Carry out your plan from question 1 and record your data here <a href="#" class="table" data-id="5">Table/Graph</a>.
        <a class="activity-button table" data-id="5" ></a>
    </li>
    <li>
        As a group, create a Whiteboard to share with the rest of the class. It should include:
        <ul>
            <li>Data table</li>
            <li>Graph with units and labels</li>
            <li>The story of your car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Take a screenshot of the whiteboard with your groupâ€™s data, and post it to our gallery.
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="4" data-view="class" data-group="1" data-heading="Group A">Group A</a>  or
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="4" data-view="class" data-group="2" data-heading="Group B">Group B</a> or
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="4" data-view="class" data-group="3" data-heading="Group C">Group C</a>.
    </li>
