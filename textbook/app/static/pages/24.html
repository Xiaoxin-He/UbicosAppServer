<h2>Buggy Lab Board Meeting</h2>
<h3></h3>


<p>
    Think back to the small group digital discussion you just had. Did someone make a particularly good point you want to share? Did someone have a great way of explaining that helped you understand? What did you discover from this activity?
In the Board Meeting be prepared to discuss the following:
Is constant speed proportional?
What are we looking for to see if this relationship is proportional?
Why do we make graphs of data?
Why do we write equations of lines?


Then, revisit the class definitions of Slope and Unit Rate in the Vocabulary page. [add vocab page]
Finally, build on your model once again in the Model-So-Far page. [add model so far page]

    First, review these Talk Moves to help you make constructive comments.
Now, in the chat, Answer these two questions about x and y.
What does the x represent in your Buggy Lab graph?
What does the y represent in your graph?

Do you have any other questions about any of the activities we are doing? Let me know in the Chat!

Give any help to / share your thoughts with your classmates.
