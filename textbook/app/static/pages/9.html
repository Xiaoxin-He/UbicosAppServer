<h2>Day 2: Homework</h2>
<h3></h3>


<p>
    In the past we have discussed proportional relationships. But this week we are talking about something bigger and broader - functions.

    For Homework today, you will have a digital discussion about the whiteboards your groups posted in the


     <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="3" data-view="comment" data-heading="Function Gallery"
        data-description="Click Group Discussions to participate in digital discussion.
                              Click My Submissions to see the images your group uploaded.">Function Gallery</a>

                <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="3" data-view="comment" data-heading="Function Gallery"
                            data-description="Click Group Discussions to participate in digital discussion.
                              Click My Submissions to see the images your group uploaded."> </a>

    You need to make at least three different posts to the digital discussion. You can post an idea about one of the
    whiteboards uploaded by another group, or respond to a classmate’s comments. Remember to use the Talk Moves to make high
    quality comments and responses that can earn you badges.


   Here are some ideas of things to discuss:
    <ul>
    <li>
        Which functions were proportional and how did you know?
    </li>
    <li>
        Which relationships were non-proportional functions?
    </li>
    <li>
        What do you think makes it a function even if it’s not proportional?
    </li>
    <li>
         What is your best definition for the term function?
    </li>
    </ul>
