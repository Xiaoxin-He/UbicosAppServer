<h2>Activity 3 - Proportional Relationship - Phet: Proportion Playground</h2>
<h3>Warm-up: Proportion Playground</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        Jean runs 5 miles in 30 minutes.  What are 3 different ratios you can write that express his average speed?
    </li>
    <li>
        John plans to run for 50 minutes. How far will he need to run to achieve the same average speed as Jean?
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Choose the group number your teacher assigns to you.</p>

<p>Toby the snail is crossing a four foot wide side-walk at a constant rate. It takes him 1 minute and 36 seconds
to scoot across half the width of the sidewalk as the picture below:</p>

<p>Find the unit rate for this proportional relationship. Be sure to explain what this unit rate means.</p>

<p>Write an equation that describes this proportional relationship if x is the amount of time it takes Toby to
cross the sidewalk and y is the distance he has traveled. Use this equation to make a table of values to graph the
first 5 seconds of Toby's journey</p>
<a> Table/ Graph </a>

<p>How long will it take Toby to cross the sidewalk?</p>
