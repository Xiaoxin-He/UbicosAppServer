<h3>Proportion Playground Task</h3>
<h4>Scene: Necklace Creator</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Desmos Expert: find the line of best fit in Desmos by typing y1~mx1+b into a new function line. Record the complete y= rule in your Google doc.</li>
    <li>Discuss with your group:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>What does the x represent in your graph?</li>
        <li>WWhat does the y represent in your graph?</li>
        <li>How is the y= rule related to the red:blue ratios from your necklaces?  Why does this make sense?</li>
        <li>How could you use your y= rule to find another necklace that matches the pattern? (Then check a sample in your Desmos table to see if it fits!)</li>
    </ul>
