<h2>Apply your Model</h2>

<p>
    I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet exactly how many cups I’ll need.
    In your group, use the blocks to create as many models as you can. What are examples of how I could apply this color to any room in my house?

    <a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="3" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here.">Brainstorm</a>
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="3" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here."></a>
     your examples here.

    Then, add a table to your whiteboard to show other possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint. [link to the whiteboard]
