<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Apply Your Model</h3>

<p>I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet exactly how many cups I’ll need.</p>

<p>In your group, use the blocks to create as many models as you can. What are examples of how I could apply this color to any room in my house?</p>

<p>Share your thoughts here on the <a href="#" class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="2" data-description="Brainstorm description">Vocabulary</a> page.
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="2"></a>
</p>

<p>Then, add a table to your whiteboard to show other possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint.</p>
