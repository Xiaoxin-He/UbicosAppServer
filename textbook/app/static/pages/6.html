<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Apply Your Model</h3>

<p>I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet exactly how many cups I’ll need. In your group, use the blocks to create as many models as you can, that give examples of how I could apply this to any room in my house.</p>

<p>Share your thoughts <a href="#" class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="2" data-description="Brainstorm description">here.</a>
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="2"></a>
</p>

<p>Then, add a table to your whiteboard to show other possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint.</p>
