<h2>Compare Volumes</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>
    Put water in the cone, and use the cone to fill in the other shapes with water.
</p>

<p>
     How many cones does it take to fill in the hemisphere? How many cones does it take to fill the cylinder.
</p>


<p>
    We'll be adding the formula for cone and hemisphere
    <a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-heading="Definitions" data-description="Important Definitions will be added here.">here</a>.
    <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="1" data-heading="Definitions" data-description="Important Definitions will be added here."></a>
</p>


<p>
    Now that you know the relationships between the volumes of the cone, hemisphere and cylinder measurements to see if you can
    come up with some evidence to explain your results.
    Record on your whiteboard, and fill in <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="page6-table" >this</a> chart on a whiteboard.
