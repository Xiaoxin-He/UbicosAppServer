<h2>Day  2</h2>

<p>

    In your small group,  pull up last night’s HW problem.
    Divide your whiteboard in half. <br/>

    On one half put your HW’s graph and on the other half sketch the graph assigned to your group.
</p>

<p>
    Is it proportional? Is it linear?  Is it a function? How do we know?


</p>

<p>

    Post a picture of your whiteboard to the <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="6" data-view="comment" data-heading="Fruit Punch"
                                        data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery</a>.
    View together as a class.


</p>

<p>What do both of your graphs have in common that make it a function?</p>
