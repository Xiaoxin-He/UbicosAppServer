    </a> <br/>

<ul>
    <li>How do you know the color will be the same in the small batch as it is in the larger batch?</li>
    <li>Can you find multiple ways to model this relationship?</li>
    <li>Can you write a rule (using words or numbers) to create this color of paint that anyone could follow
    for any number of cups?</li>
    <li>Explain your thinking in words and draw arrows or labels to help others understand your thinking.</li>

</ul>
