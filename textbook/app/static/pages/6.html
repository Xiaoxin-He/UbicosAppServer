<h1>Explain your Model </h1>

<p>
    Paste your Unifix screenshot on this
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a> tool. As you are working on your whiteboard, discuss with your group in the

    <a class="chatCard" data-id="1" data-heading="Chat">group chat</a>.
    <a class="activity-button chatCard" data-id="1" data-heading="Chat"> </a>

</p>
<p>
When making the <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a>, think about these questions:
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="">
    </a> <br/>
<ul>
    <li>How do you know the color will be the same in the small batch as it is in the larger batch?</li>
    <li>Can you find multiple ways to model this relationship?</li>
    <li>Can you write a rule (using words or numbers) to create this color of paint that anyone could follow
    for any number of cups?</li>
    <li>Explain your thinking in words and draw arrows or labels to help others understand your thinking.</li>

</ul>
