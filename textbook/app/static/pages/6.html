    Go back to the comments section from the cone video from the homework last night. Did you make a comment?
    Did someone respond to your comment? What do you think about their response?

</p>

<p>
    When you are done with Khan Academy, work with your small group to create a whiteboard that shows how you solved the cone problems from last night’s homework.

Be ready to discuss...
    <ul>
        <li>
            Did your understanding of calculating the volume of a cylinder change since you did homework last night?
        </li>
        <li>
            What misconceptions did you see as you were helping others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Did your understanding change based on something you saw in the comments?
        </li>
    </ul>

    Our student council is providing fruit punch at the local carnival. The council has cylinder shaped cups in four different sizes. They must serve punch in two sizes, one for adults and one for children. The carnival is expecting approximately 160 adults and 230 children to attend. The
student council has purchased enough ingredients to make 8 bowls of punch. The punch bowl used for serving the punch is in the shape of a half-sphere. How can our class determine which size cups would be best to serve all adults and children at the carnival?

<!--<p>I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet exactly how many cups I’ll need.</p>-->

<!--<p>In your group, use the blocks to create as many models as you can. What are examples of how I could apply this color to any room in my house?</p>-->

<!--<p>Then, add a table to your whiteboard to show other possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint.</p>-->
