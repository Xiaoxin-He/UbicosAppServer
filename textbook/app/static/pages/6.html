<h3>Graphing Distance and Time</h3>
 <p>The motion of an object can be represented by a distance-time graph like Graph 1 in the Figure below. In this type of graph, the y-axis
     represents distance and the x-axis represents time. A distance-time graph shows how far an object has traveled at any given time since
     it started moving. However, it doesnâ€™t show the direction(s) the object has traveled. </p>

<p>Q: In graph 1 above, what distance has the object traveled by the time 5 seconds have elapsed? <br/>
    <a href="" >Clicker/polling tool</a> <br/>
    A: The object has traveled a distance of about 25 meters. <br/>
    This is the rate of change.
</p>

<p> What distance has the object traveled in one second? <br/>

This is the unit rate. <br/>

Calculating rate (unit rate?) rise over run. Examples that are not speed. <br/>
Add question similar to one seeded on Khan Academy. Speed/rate as the slope of the graph.
