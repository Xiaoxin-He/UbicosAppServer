<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Apply Your Model</h3>

<p>I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet exactly how many cups I’ll need.</p>

<p>In your group, use the blocks to create as many models as you can. What are examples of how I could apply this color to any room in my house?</p>

<p><a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="3" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here.">Brainstorm</a> your examples here.
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="3" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here."></a>
</p>

<p>Then, add a table to your whiteboard to show other possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint.</p>
