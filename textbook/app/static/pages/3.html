<h2>Compare Volumes</h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>
        We’ve discussed circles and 3-D versions of them. We also discussed volume (the amount of space something takes up).
        Today we’re going to focus on volume and start by comparing the volume of a sphere, cone, and cylinder.

</p>

<p>
        Look at the sphere, cone, and cylinder in front of you.
        Predict the order of the volume from least to greatest - which one could you fill with the most “stuff”? Least?

        Discuss your prediction with other students. Defend your answer. Even if everyone agrees, you need to be solid on why you have put
        them in this particular order and be able to explain your reasoning.
