<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>
    Let’s have a class discussion about what the graph shows us in this activity.
</p>

<p>

    Think back to the small group digital discussion you just had.
    Did someone make a particularly good point you want to share?
    Did someone have a great way of explaining that helped you understand?
    What did you discover from this activity?

</p>

<p>
    Tell your group: how do you know you’re looking at a proportional relationship?
