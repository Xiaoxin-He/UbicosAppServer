<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>
Let’s have a class discussion about what the graph shows us in this activity.
</p>

<p>

Think back to the small group digital discussion you just had.
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="6" data-view="comment" data-heading="Fruit Punch"
                                        data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery</a>
    Did someone make a particularly good point you want to share?
    Did someone have a great way of explaining that helped you understand? What did you discover from this activity?

</p>

<p>
    Tell your group: how do you know you’re looking at a  proportional relationship?
