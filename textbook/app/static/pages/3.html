<h2>Day 2 - Proportional Relationship - Phet: Proportion Playground</h2>
<p>
    If I want to scale this up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, Iâ€™m not sure
    I want to do that big number with blocks. Is there a rule we could write that would have helped us figure out this
    ratio without having to make a model? <br/>
    Let see if we can create a rule that would allow us to figure out how these two numbers are related to each other. </p>

<p>
    Write the rule in sentences. <br/>
    How could we write this as an equation?
    <!--<a class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-description="Brainstorm Description">brainstorm.</a>-->

<p>
    As a group - project the graph with data points. Graph the rule over top. <br/>
    Does it match with the data we collected. <br/>

    What if I needed 100 cups to paint the whole house? 275? Just one cup to paint a doll house? <br/>
