<h1>Return of the Ratio Assignment</h1>

<p>
    Offering help is not a one time activity. Today, you have the opportunity to look back at the help you
    gave to other students and continue the conversation. As you are responding to the comments, ask yourself
    do you agree with what they have said? Can you offer a counter example to anyone’s comment  to keep them thinking?
    Try: “What if the situation was _______ instead? Would that make a difference?”
