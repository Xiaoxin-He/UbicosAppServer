<h2>Paint Splash</h2>
<h3>Discuss Your Ratios</h3>

<p>Now, discuss your models with your group:</p>

    <p>How are the color:color ratios different for each paint splash? How are they the same?</p>
    <p>How would you describe the paint splash you created? What kind of rule can describe how to make your paint color?
        One member of your group should type your response(s) in complete sentences in your Gallery #2.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="class">Upload a Picture to your Gallery</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>As a group, create a rule using words and an equation using the y = mx format. You can enter your equation in the <a href="#" class="table" data-id="3">Equation</a> tab.
        <a class="activity-button table" data-id="3"></a>
    </p>

    <p>Now, as a group, <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="user-input-page10-input1" >Answer</a> these two questions about x and y.
    <a class="activity-button multQues" data-id="user-input-page10-input1"></a> <br/><br/>

    <p>Next, as a group, <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="user-input-page10-input2" >Answer</a> these two questions about your equation.
    <a class="activity-button multQues" data-id="user-input-page10-input2"></a>
