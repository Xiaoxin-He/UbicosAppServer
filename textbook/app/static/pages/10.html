<h1>Create your own color</h1>

<p>
    I love my Perfect Purple Paint, but you probably want to come up with your own awesome color for your house. Check out

    Paint Splash</a> here!

    <a class="activity-button video" data-id="3" data-video-url="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/proportion-playground"></a>

</p>

<p>
    As a group, create a color splash of your choice in the
    <a class="video" data-id="3" data-video-url="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/proportion-playground">
    Paint Splash</a> tool. Each group member should use the double paint splash setting to recreate
    your group’s paint splash on the left. Then on the right create either a larger or
    smaller matching batch (each group member should create a different sized matching paint splash on the right).
    After you are done, enter all the group members ratios into a
    <a href="#" class="table" data-id="1" data-heading="Paint Splash Table">Paint Splash Table</a>.
    <a class="activity-button table" data-id="1" data-heading="Paint Splash Table"></a>

    </p>

<p>
    Next, you'll create a whiteboard. Remember, your
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a>
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url=""></a>
    needs:
    <ul>
        <li> A Title</li>
        <li> A screenshot of one person’s double paint splash (2 batches) </li>
        <li> A screenshot of the table that lists your group members’ batches </li>
        <li> A screenshot of your graph </li>
        <li> A written explanation about how you know how to find any size batch for your color. </li>
        <li> A rule in words and numbers.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
 A member from each group will take a screenshot of their whiteboard solution. Then upload the screenshot in the

    <a href="#" class="upload" data-id="2" data-heading="Paint Splash Upload"
               data-description="">Paint Splash Gallery</a>.
      <a href="#" class="activity-button upload" data-id="2" data-heading="Paint Splash Upload"
