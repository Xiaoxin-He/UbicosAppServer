<h2>Day 3</h2>



<p>
Take a picture of your whiteboard and add it to your gallery. Then look at the whiteboards of other groups.
 <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" >Visit the Gallery.</a>
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" > </a>
    <li>
     Do you have any questions about what you see? Is there any help you can give to the group? Anything you liked or thought was creative?
    </li>
