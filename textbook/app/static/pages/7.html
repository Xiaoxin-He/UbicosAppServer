<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Find a Rule</h3>

<p>If I want to scale up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, Iâ€™m not sure I want to do a physical model with blocks for numbers that big. Use the unit rate from yesterday to help write a rule we could use to help us find how much paint would be needed without having to make a physical model.</p>

<p>Follow the following two steps to help you write the rule: </p>
Answer the following two question
Answer these questions about your rule

<ol>

    <li>
        <a class="activity-button multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input1"></a>
        Write the rule in complete sentences. <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input1" >Answer</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now try to turn your rule into an equation. <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input1" >Answer</a>
    </li>

    <li>

        How/Why does your equation fit with all the other representations? <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input2" >Answer</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="activity-button multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input2"></a>
        Does your rule match the data we collected? What if I needed 100 cups to paint the whole house? 275?
        Just one cup to paint a doll house?
