<h2>Day 2: Homework</h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>
    In the past we have discussed proportional relationships. But this week we are talking about something bigger, functions.

    For Homework today, you will have a digital discussion about the whiteboards your groups posted in the Modelbook Gallery.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="5" data-view="comment" data-heading="Cones"
       data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions." > </a>

    You need to make at least two comments and make responses to at least two other people’s comments. Remember to use the Talk moves to make high quality comments and responses.


    Here are some ideas of things to discuss
    -Which functions were proportional and how did you know?
    -Which relationships were non-proportional functions? What do you think makes it a function even if it’s not proportional? Can you agree on a definition of a function?
