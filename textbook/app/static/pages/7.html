<h2>Find a Rule</h2>

<p>

    If I want to scale up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, Iâ€™m not sure I want to do a physical model with blocks for
    numbers that big. Use the unit rate from yesterday to help write a rule we could use to help us find how much paint would be needed without
    having to make a physical model.

</p>

<p>
    Now, Answer these questions about your rule.
    <ul>
    <li>
        How/Why does your equation relate to your physical model, drawing, table, and graph? (text box)
    </li>
     <li>
        How does your equation match the data in the graph?
    </li>
    <li>
        How many cups of red and blue paint would I need if it took 100 cups to paint the whole house? 275? Just one cup to paint a doll house? (text box)
    </li>
</ul>
