<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Find a Rule</h3>

<p>If I want to scale up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, Iâ€™m not sure I want to do a physical model with blocks for numbers that big. Use the unit rate from yesterday to help write a rule we could use to help us find how much paint would be needed without having to make a physical model.</p>
