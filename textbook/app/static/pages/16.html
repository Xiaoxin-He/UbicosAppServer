<h2>Paint Splash Gallery Discussion</h2>
<h3></h3>


<p>

    Visit the Gallery of other groups to observe their paint splashes, tables, graphs, and rules. Leave a comment on each picture.
    Ask a question, give a compliment, or explain what you are thinking. Be specific. Do you have any questions about what you see?
    Is there any help you can give to the group? Anything you liked or thought was creative?

    After you have commented individually, move to the group discussion.
    Discuss the similarities and differences between the graphs. What features do they share? Why do you think they share these features?


    Can you add on to what other people in your group are saying. Try, “I understand what you’re saying. I would like to add that …”
