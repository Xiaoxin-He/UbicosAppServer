<h1>Buggy Lab Board Meeting</h1>

<p>
    Think back to the small group digital discussion you just had. Did someone make a particularly good point you want to share? Did someone have a great way of explaining that helped you understand? What did you discover from this activity?

</p>
<p>
    In the whiteboard Meeting be prepared to discuss the following: [add the same whiteboard link here from the previous page]

        <li> Is constant speed proportional? </li>
        <li> What are we looking for to see if this relationship is proportional? </li>
        <li> Why do we make graphs of data? </li>
        <li> Why do we write equations of lines? </li>
</p>

Then, revisit the class definitions of Slope and Unit Rate in the Vocabulary page. [add vocab page]
Finally, build on your model once again in the Model-So-Far page. [add model so far page]
