<h2>Create A Model</h2>

<p>

I’ve found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint. That makes one batch of Perfect Purple Paint.
I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches.


Let’s make a model using blocks to represent the information in this problem.

<a class="video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/">
    Open Unifix Tool</a>.
<a class="activity-button video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/"></a>

Have one color block represent red paint and another color block represent blue paint.
Show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint using the Unifix tool? <br/>

Can you find multiple ways to model this relationship? Can you use this <a class="video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/">
    Whiteboard Tool</a>.
<a class="activity-button video" data-id="1" data-video-url="http://www.didax.com/apps/unifix/"></a>
    to write a rule (using words or numbers) to create this color of paint that anyone could follow?
Explain your thinking in words and draw arrows or labels to help others understand your thinking.  <br/>

Take a screenshot of your solution whiteboard and upload to the Perfect Purple Paint Gallery #1.
