<h3>Perfect Purple Paint</h3>
<p>I have found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint.
    That makes one batch of Perfect Purple Paint. <br/><br/>

I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches. A red block represents
    red paint and a blue block represents blue paint. <br/><br/>

Use the blocks to show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint.
    How much of each color would be needed to to make 20 cups of Perfect Purple Paint? </p>
