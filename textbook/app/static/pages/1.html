<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
    In the next three weeks, we will be interacting with your
    fellow classmates and others to learn and help teach some math concepts.

    Find the navigation sidebar to your left (<img src="/index.png" alt="ss_icon" style="width: 7%; margin: 0px 0px -10px 0px">), and
    on your right find different interaction badges. You can
    navigate between the pages either by using the arrows at the bottom of the
    page or by using the navigation sidebar.
