<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I have found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint. That makes one batch of Perfect Purple Paint.</p>

<p>I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches.</p>
