<h2>Day 1: Model how two values compare to each other?</h2>
<h3>Perfect Purple Paint</h3>
<p>I have found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint.
    That makes one batch of Perfect Purple Paint. <br/><br/>

I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches. A red block represents
    red paint and a blue block represents blue paint. <br/><br/>

Use the blocks to show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint.
    How much of each color would be needed to to make 20 cups of Perfect Purple Paint?

        When your group reaches a consensus, write your groups names on the board, draw your solution on a whiteboard,
        and explain your thinking in words. Also, place your blocks on the whiteboard so you can take a picture of your
        blocks along with the rest of your solution. <br/>

        Take a picture of your solution and post it to the gallery.

        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" data-group="1">Group 1</a>  or
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" data-group="2">Group 2</a>.

    <!--<a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" >Visit the Gallery.</a>-->
    <!--<a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" > </a>-->

    </li>

    <li>
        Look at other groups’ solutions and leave a comment on each picture. Ask a question, give a complement, or explain what you are thinking. <br/>
        Do you agree with their solutions?

        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" data-group="1">Group 1</a>  or
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" data-group="2">Group 2</a>. <br/>
    </li>

        Based on the comments you received, make any changes to your board you would like to make.
