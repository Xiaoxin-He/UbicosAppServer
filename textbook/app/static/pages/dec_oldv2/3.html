<ol style="list-style: none;">
    <li>
        Add a table to your whiteboard to show other possible quantities that would create the same color of purple paint.
        <br/><br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        Let's share your whiteboards. <br/>
        We want to make sure we all agree on the terms we are using. Are there any words we need to define as a class?

        <a class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-description="Brainstorm description">Share your thoughts here. </a>
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="1"></a>
        <br/><br/>
    </li>

    <li>
        Add your data to the table #1. Then add some data from other groups to your own personal table.
        <a class="activity-button table" data-id="1"></a>
        <br/><br/>
    </li>

    <li>
        When you finish adding points to Table #1, click the  “plot the line” button under the graph.
        Sketch your graph on your whiteboard.
        <a href="#" class="table" data-id="1">Table/Graph</a>.
        <br/><br/>
    </li>

    <li>
        Let’s the special relationship we noticed. Are there any characteristics we can add now that we’ve seen what they
        look like in a table and in a graph? In the chat discuss ideas that you’d want to add to our model so far.

        <a class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-description="Brainstorm description">Share your thoughts here. </a>
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="1"></a>
        <br/><br/>
    </li>
</ol>
