<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol style="list-style: none;">

    <li>Using the materials at hand, our task is to devise a method of determining how fast our car moves as confidently as possible.
        let's create our class plan on a large whiteboard.
        <!--<a href="#" class="moreinfo" data-id="2">More Information</a>-->
        <!--<a class="activity-button moreinfo" data-id="1" ></a>-->
        <ul>
            <li>What measurements should we take?</li>
            <li>What units will we use?</li>
            <li>Do we plan to take more than one set of data?</li>
            <li>What procedures do we need to follow so that our data is as accurate and comparable as possible?</li>
        </ul>
        <br/><br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a table on your whiteboard to collect your data.
        <br/><br/>

        Letâ€™s take a picture of our directions so you can reference them as you do the experiment. [add gallery]
