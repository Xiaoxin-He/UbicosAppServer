<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>
    Let’s have a class discussion about what the graph shows us in this activity.
</p>

<p>

    Think back to the small group digital discussion you just had.
    Did someone make a particularly good point you want to share?
    Did someone have a great way of explaining that helped you understand?
    What did you discover from this activity?

</p>

<p>
    Tell your group: how do you know you’re looking at a proportional relationship?
    Go to this
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="comment" data-heading="Gallery 2"
       data-description="Click on the images in Group Discussions tab to participate in digital discussion.
                              Click My Submissions to see the images your group uploaded.">gallery</a>
    to view our class consensus about identifying proportional relationships.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="2" data-view="comment" data-heading="Gallery 2"
              data-description="Click on the images in Group Discussions tab to participate in digital discussion.
                              Click My Submissions to see the images your group uploaded." > </a>
</p>

<p>
    A proportional relationship is one kind of function. We will be learning about other kinds of functions this week.
