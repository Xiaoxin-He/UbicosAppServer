<h2>Compare Volumes</h2>

<p>
    Fill the shapes - use the cone to fill each of the other shapes with water.
</p>

<p>
     How many cones does it take to fill in the hemisphere? How many cones does it take to fill the cylinder.
</p>


<p>
    What is the volume relationship between cone and cylinder?
    <a class="activity-button multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input1"></a>
    <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="user-input-page7-input1" >Answer</a> the following two questions you understand the relationship.
</p>



<p>
    Add the formula for cone and hemisphere
    <a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here.">here</a>.
    <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="1" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here."></a>
</p>


<p>
    Now that you know the relationships between the volumes of the cone, hemisphere and cylinder measurements to see if you can
    come up with some evidence to explain your results.
    Record on your whiteboard, and fill in this chart on a whiteboard.
