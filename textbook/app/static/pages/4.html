<h2>Day 2 - Proportional Relationships</h2>

<p>
    <li>
        If I want to scale this up and use the Perfect Purple Paint on my whole house, Iâ€™m not sure I want to do a physically model that big number with blocks.
        Is there a rule we could write that would help us figure out this ratio without having to make a model? Write the rule in complete sentences.

        <textarea class="page6-input" rows="4" cols="50" name="page4-input1" required> </textarea>
        <input id="page4-submit1" type="submit" value="Submit" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

    </li>
    <li>
        Let see if we can create a rule that would allow us to figure out how these quantities are related to each other. <br/>
        <textarea class="page6-input" rows="4" cols="50" name="page4-input2" required> </textarea>
        <input id="page4-submit2" type="submit" value="Submit" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        Create a whiteboard to explain your thinking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Does it match with the data we collected. What if I needed 100 cups to paint the whole house? 275? Just one cup to paint a doll house?
        <a href="#" class="table" data-id="2">Table/Graph</a>.
        <a class="activity-button table" data-id="2" ></a>

    </li>
