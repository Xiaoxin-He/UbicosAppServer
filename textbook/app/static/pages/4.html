<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Refine Your Model</h3>

<p>Let's share your whiteboards.</p>

<p>We want to make sure we all agree on the terms we are using. Are there any words we need to define as a class? Share your thoughts <a href="#" class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-description="Brainstorm description">here.</a><a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="1"></a></p>

<p>Add your data to <a href="#" class="table" data-id="1">Table #1</a>. Then add some data from other groups to Table #1.<a class="activity-button table" data-id="1"></a>

<p>When you finish adding points to Table #1, click the  “plot the line” button under the graph. Sketch your graph on your whiteboard.</p>
        
<p>Let’s revisit the special relationship we noticed. Are there any characteristics we can add now that we’ve seen what they look like in a table and in a graph? In the chat discuss ideas that you’d want to add to our model so far.</p>
