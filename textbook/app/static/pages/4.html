<h2>Activity 2 - Slope and Unit Rate</h2>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<p>Besides using words like fast and slow how else can we compare object's motion?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start by thinking/writing a simple scenario to compare a fast moving and a slow moving object</li>
    <li>Then compare their motion in number line</li>
</ol>

<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Write a Motion Scenario one for a fast object and one for a slow object</li>
    <li>Draw a number line and distance time graphs without data</li>

<h4>Number Line Speed</h4>
<p>On each number line, you will see two cars: an initial car (dashed) and a final car (solid).
    Above each car is a stopwatch Assume that the position scales are calibrated in centimeters and the
    stopwatches are calibrated in seconds.
</p>
<p>Explanation -- this is how fast your car is going. Doesnâ€™t help unless we represent it as a unit
    rate like speed. Find the speed by calculating how fast it goes in 1 second.</p>
