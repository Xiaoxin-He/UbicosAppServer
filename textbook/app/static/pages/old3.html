<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Conduct a Board Meeting and discuss the following:  Whose car went the fastest? Is easy to compare? Why or why not?</li>
    <li>The commonly accepted definition of speed is distance divided by time and the metric unit is the meters traveled by the object in 1
        second (expressed with shorthand as m/s). <a href="#" class="convert" data-id="2">inches per second to meters per second</a>
        <a class="activity-button convert" data-id="3" ></a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make any changes to your whiteboard need to represent the data in standard format <a href="#" class="" data-id="3">More Information</a>.
        <a class="activity-button more" data-id="2" ></a>
        Post a picture of your changed whiteboard.

    <li>Compare your results with the members of other groups. Is it easier to compare? Which group’s car went the fastest? Explain.

<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Report out as a class.
    (draw out in discussion: distance over time = speed, m/s is unit rate, have fastest and slowest class data shown on one graph, slope indicates speed, similarities are that all lines pass through zero, this is y-intercept, label as b)
</li>

</ol>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Agree on <a href="#">class definitions</a> of Unit rate, slope, y-intercept</li>
