<h2>Paint Splash</h2>
<h3>Create Your Own Color</h3>

<p>I love my Perfect Purple Paint, but you probably want to come up with your own awesome color for your house. To do that, we’re going to use
    <a class="video" data-id="2" data-video-url="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/proportion-playground/latest/proportion-playground_en.html">
    Paint Splash</a>.
    <a class="activity-button video" data-id="2" data-video-url="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/proportion-playground/latest/proportion-playground_en.html"></a>
    Working as a group in Paint Splash in the single paint splash mode, create a paint splash of your choice. Your group needs to agree on the color.</p>

<p>Each group member should then use the double paint splash to recreate your group’s paint splash on the left.
    And then on the right create either a larger or smaller matching batch (each group member should create a different
    sized matching paint splash on the right).</p>

<p>Take a screenshot of one person’s screen to post and upload to your Gallery #2.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="class">Upload a Picture to your Gallery</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
