<h2>Activity 3 - Proportional Relationship - Phet: Proportion Playground</h2>
<h3>Anchor Problem: Proportionality nd Unit Rate</h3>
<p>Toby the snail is crossing a four foot wide side-walk at a constant rate. It takes him 1 minute and 36 seconds
to scoot across half the width of the sidewalk as the picture below:</p>

<p>Find the unit rate for this proportional relationship. Be sure to explain what this unit rate means.</p>

<p>Write an equation that describes this proportional relationship if x is the amount of time it takes Toby to
cross the sidewalk and y is the distance he has traveled. Use this equation to make a table of values to graph the
first 5 seconds of Toby's journey</p>
<a> Table/ Graph </a>

<p>How long will it take Toby to cross the sidewalk?</p>
