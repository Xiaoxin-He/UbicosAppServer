<h2>Day 2: Homework</h2>
<h3></h3>


<p>
    In the past we have discussed proportional relationships. But this week we are talking about something bigger and broader - functions.

    For Homework today, you will have a digital discussion about the whiteboards your groups posted in the


     <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="3" data-view="comment" data-heading="Function Gallery"
                                        data-description="Click on Group Discussion to participate in digital discussion. You can click the My Submissions button to see the images your group uploaded.">Function Gallery</a>

                <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="3" data-view="comment" data-heading="Function Gallery"
                           data-description="Click on Group Discussion to participate in digital discussion.
                                          You can click the My Submissions button to see the images your group uploaded." > </a>
    You need to make at least two comments of your own and respond to at least two other people’s comments. Remember to use the Talk moves to make high quality comments and responses.


   Here are some ideas of things to discuss
    -Which functions were proportional and how did you know?
    -Which relationships were non-proportional functions?
    - What do you think makes it a function even if it’s not proportional?
    - Can you agree on a definition of a function?
