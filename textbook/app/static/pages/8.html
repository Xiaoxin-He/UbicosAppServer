<h2>Serving Fruit Punch</h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>
    Our student council is providing fruit punch at the local carnival. The council has cylinder shaped cups in four different sizes. They must serve punch in two sizes, one for adults and one for children. The carnival is expecting approximately 160 adults and 230 children to attend. The
    student council has purchased enough ingredients to make 8 bowls of punch. The punch bowl used for serving the punch is in the shape of a half-sphere.</p>

<p>
    How can our class determine which size cups would be best to serve all adults and children at the carnival?

Use the unit rate from yesterday to help write a rule we could use to help us find how much paint would be needed without having to make a physical model.</p>-->
