<h2>Day 3</h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>Get your group whiteboards from yesterday. You have 5 minutes to make any changes you want to make based on your
        digital discussion from your homework last night.</p>

<p>After your edits, we will move into a circle for a whiteboard meeting. Sit and get comfortable!</p>

<p>For any of these examples, we could create a table with a very consistent and predictable pattern.
        We can see this pattern when we graph these functions.
