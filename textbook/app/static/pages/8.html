<h2>Compare Volumes</h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>
    Now that you know the relationships between the volumes of the cone, hemisphere and cylinder measurements to see if you can
    come up with some evidence to explain your results.
    Record on your whiteboard, and fill in this chart on a whiteboard.

</p>

<p>
    Using your chart, answer the following questions.
    What’s the ratio of circumference/diameter?
    Cone to Hemisphere
    Cone to Cylinder
</p>

<p>

    Take a picture of your whiteboard. It should include your table, as well as the formulas we discussed in the Whiteboard meeting
