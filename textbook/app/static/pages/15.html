    I love my Perfect Purple Paint, but you probably want to come up with your own awesome color for your house. Check out

<p>
    Working as a group in Paint Splash in the single paint splash mode, create a paint splash of your choice. Your group needs to agree on the color.
    Each group member should then use the double paint splash setting to recreate your group’s paint splash on the left. And then on the right create
    either a larger or smaller matching batch (each group member should create a different sized matching paint splash on the right).
    Enter all the group members Ratios into the graphing tool.

<p>
    Smoosh everything from Perfect Purple Paint onto the left side of your whiteboard, draw a line down the middle and add the following to the right hand side:
    <ul>
        <li>A Title</li>
        <li>A screenshot of one person’s double paint splash. (2 different sized batches.)</li>
        <li>A table that lists your group members’ batches.</li>
        <li> A screenshot of your graph.</li>
    </ul>
