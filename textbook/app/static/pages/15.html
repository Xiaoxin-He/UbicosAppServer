<h2>Day 5 - Slope and Unit Rate</h2>
<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Conduct a Board Meeting and discuss the following:  Whose car went the fastest? Is easy to compare? Why or why not?</li>
    <li>The commonly accepted definition of speed is distance divided by time and the metric unit is the meters traveled by the object in 1
        second (expressed with shorthand as m/s).
        <!--<a href="#" class="convert" data-id="2">inches per second to meters per second</a>-->
        <!--<a class="activity-button convert" data-id="3" ></a>-->
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Compare your results with the members of other groups. Is it easier to compare? Which groupâ€™s car went the fastest? Explain.
       <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="group">Visit the Gallery.</a>
        <a class="activity-button gallery" data-id="2" data-view="group"></a>
    </li>

</ol>
<h3>In Person</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Continue whiteboard meeting. Whos car went the fastest? How can the graph help us identify the fastest car?
    </li>

</ol>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Agree on <a href="#">class definitions</a> of Unit rate, slope, y-intercept</li>
    <li>Create a written rule and an equation that will apoximate the slope of their line.</li>
