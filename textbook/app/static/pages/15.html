    Now that you understand the parts of a function you can easily read as well as draw graphs that help you understand situation(s)
    that an equation is describing.

    A conceptual graph doesnâ€™t need exact numbers to help tell the story. It just needs accurate labels.

</p>

<p>

    Now that you are familiar with conceptual graph, draw a conceptual graph of the
     <a href="#" class="multQues" data-id="day4graph">scenario</a>
        <a class="activity-button multQues" data-id="day4graph"></a>
   that is assigned to your group on your whiteboard.
