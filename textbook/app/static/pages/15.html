<h2>Understanding Other Examples</h2>
<h3>Help Your Classmates</h3>

<p>Take a picture of your whiteboard and add it to your gallery.
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="3" data-view="class" data-group="1" data-heading="Group A">Group A</a>  or
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="3" data-view="class" data-group="2" data-heading="Group B">Group B</a> or
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="3" data-view="class" data-group="3" data-heading="Group C">Group C</a>.
</p>

<p>Then look at the whiteboards of other groups.
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="3" data-view="comment" >Gallery</a>
        <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="3" data-view="comment" > </a>
Do you have any questions about what you see? Is there any help you can give to the group? Anything you liked or thought was creative?</p>

<p>Look at your own whiteboard and think about the comments the other groups left.</p>
