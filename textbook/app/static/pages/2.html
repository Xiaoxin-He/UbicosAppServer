        When your group reaches a consensus, write your group members’ names on the board, draw your solution on a whiteboard,
        and explain your thinking in words. You only need to upload one picture from each group. <br/>

        Take a picture of your solution and post it to your group respective gallery:

        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" data-group="1" data-heading="Group A">Group A</a>  or
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" data-group="2" data-heading="Group B">Group B</a> or
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" data-group="3" data-heading="Group C">Group C</a>.

    <!--<a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" >Visit the Gallery.</a>-->
    <!--<a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="class" > </a>-->
        <br/><br/>
    </li>

     <li>
        Look at other groups’ solutions and leave a comment on each picture. Ask a question, give a complement, or explain what you are thinking.
        Be specific. Do you agree with their solutions? Review these Talk Moves to help you make constructive comments.

        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" >Gallery</a>
        <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" > </a>

         Together review the comments your group received. Is there anything you would change on your board based from your classmates feedback?

        I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet
        exactly how many cups I’ll need. In your group, use the blocks to create as many models as you can,
        that give examples of how I could apply this to any room in my house.
