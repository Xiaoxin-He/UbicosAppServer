<h2>Day 1: Model how two values compare to each other?</h2>

<p> 5 minutes - I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet
    exactly how many cups I’ll need. In your group, create as many models as you can (at least one per
    person in each group), that show your thinking about how I could apply this to any room in my house. </p>


<p>
    10 minutes - Prepare a whiteboard To explain of your thinking.
