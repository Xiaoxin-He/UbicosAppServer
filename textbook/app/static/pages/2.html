<h2>Day 1: Model how two values compare to each other?</h2>

<ol>
     <li>
        Look at other groups’ solutions and leave a comment on each picture. Ask a question, give a complement, or explain what you are thinking.
        Be specific. Do you agree with their solutions?


        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" >Gallery</a>
        <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" > </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on the comments you received, discuss any changes that need to be made. Make your changes. <br/>
        Post another picture to the gallery. Explain why you made the changes you made under the photo.

<p> I love this color so much, I might use it for other rooms in my house, but I’m not sure yet
    exactly how many cups I’ll need. In your group, create as many models as you can (at least one per
    person in each group), that show your thinking about how I could apply this to any room in my house. </p>


<p>
    Prepare a whiteboard to explain your methods and thinking.
    <a class="brainstorm" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-description="Brainstorm description">Share your thoughts here. </a>
        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="1"></a>
