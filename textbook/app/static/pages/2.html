<h2>Explore the properties of Shapes</h2>


<p>
    As a group, make a whiteboard that includes the two homework problems you solved in Khan Academy,
    the misconceptions you were addressing when you answered your question, and any helpful feedback you received.
    Post a picture of your whiteboard to the
    <!--<ul>-->
        <!--<li>-->
            <!--<a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="class">Upload a Picture to your Gallery</a>-->
        <!--</li>-->
    <!--</ul>-->
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery #2</a>.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="2" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions." > </a>


</p>
<p>
    As a class,  Add your definitions
    <a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here.">here</a>.
    <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="1" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here."></a>

</p>

<p>
    <p></p>
    Now, based on the homework, review othersâ€™ whiteboards from the
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery #1</a> and leave comments.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions." > </a>

</p>

<p>
    Have a group discussion where you try to come to a consensus about the properties of the different shapes and what you should include on each whiteboard.
    Then, have a whole class whiteboard meeting.
</p>

<p>
    You can add your definitions of key concepts
    <a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here.">here</a>.
    <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="1" data-heading="Brainstorm Ideas" data-description="Brainstorm your examples here."></a>
