        Look at other groups’ solutions and leave a comment on each picture. Ask a question, give a complement, or explain what you are thinking.

        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" >Gallery</a>
        <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" > </a>
    </li>

        <a class="activity-button brainstorm" data-id="1"></a>
