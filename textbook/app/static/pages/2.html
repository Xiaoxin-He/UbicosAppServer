<h2>Explore the Properties of Shapes</h2>


<p>
    As a group, make a whiteboard that includes the two homework problems you solved in Khan Academy,
    the misconceptions you were addressing when you answered your question, and any helpful feedback you received.
    Post a picture of your whiteboard to the
    <!--<ul>-->
        <!--<li>-->
            <!--<a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="class">Upload a Picture to your Gallery</a>-->
        <!--</li>-->
    <!--</ul>-->
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="2" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery #2</a>.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="2" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions." > </a>


</p>


<p>

    Now, based on your new knowledge from the homework, review othersâ€™ whiteboards in
    <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions.">Gallery #1.</a>
    <a href="#" class="activity-button gallery" data-id="1" data-view="comment" data-description="Click on other groups' submissions to comment on them. You can click the My Submissions button to see others' comments on your submissions." > </a>
    Have a group discussion where you try to come to a consensus about the properties of the different shapes and what you should include on each whiteboard.
    Here are
    <a href="#" class="moreinfo" data-id="1" data-view="class">Talk Moves</a> that can help you to make posts.
    <a href="#" class="activity-button moreinfo" data-id="1" data-view="class" ></a>

</p>

<p>
    Then, have a whole class whiteboard meeting. We'll be adding our definitions of key concepts
    <a href="#" class="brainstorm bs" data-title="brainstorm1" data-id="1" data-heading="Definitions" data-description="Important Definitions will be added here.">here</a>.
    <a class="activity-button brainstorm bs" data-id="1" data-heading="Definitions" data-description="Important Definitions will be added here."></a>
