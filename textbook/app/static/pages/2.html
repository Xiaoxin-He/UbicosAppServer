<h2>Perfect Purple Paint</h2>
<h3>Create a Model</h3>

<p>Let’s make a model using blocks to represent this problem and help us find a solution. Have one color block represent red paint and another color block represent blue paint.</p>

<p>Use the blocks to show <strong><i>how</i></strong> you could make 20 cups of purple paint. <strong><i>How much</i></strong> of each color would be needed to to make 20 cups of Perfect Purple Paint?</p>

<p>When your group reaches a consensus, write your group members’ names on the board, draw your solution on a whiteboard, and explain your thinking in words.</p>
