    and click on “Group Discussions.”

    Now have a small group discussion about your graphs. Be sure to discuss the following with your group:
    <ul>
        <li>What is the rate of change for each graph?</li>
        <li>What does a rate of change on a graph mean? </li>
        <li>What does it mean specifically for this graph? </li>
        <li>What did we discover?</li>
    </ul>
