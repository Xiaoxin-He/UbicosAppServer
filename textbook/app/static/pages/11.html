    When you are done with Khan Academy, work with your small group to create a whiteboard that shows how you solved the cone problems from last nightâ€™s homework.

Be ready to discuss...
    <ul>
        <li>
            Did your understanding of calculating the volume of a cylinder change since you did homework last night?
        </li>
        <li>
            What misconceptions did you see as you were helping others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Did your understanding change based on something you saw in the comments?
        </li>
    </ul>
