<h2>Discuss your Ratios</h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>
   Now, discuss your models with your group:
    How are the color:color ratios different for each paint splash? How are they the same?
    How would you describe the paint splash you created? What kind of rule can describe how to make your paint color?
    One member of your group should type your response(s) in complete sentences in your Gallery #2.

<p>
    As a group, create a rule using words and an equation using the y = mx format. You can enter your equation in the Equation tab.
    Now, as a group, Answer these two questions about x and y.
    <ul>
        <li>
            What does the x represent in your graph?
        </li>
        <li>
            What does the y represent in your graph?
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

    Next, as a group, Answer these two questions about your equation.
    <ul>
        <li>
            How is the y= rule related to the blue:yellow ratios from your paint splashes?  Does this make sense, why or why not?
        </li>
        <li>
            How could you use your y= rule to find another paint splash that matches the color? (Then check a sample in your graph to see if it fits!)
        </li>
    </ul>
