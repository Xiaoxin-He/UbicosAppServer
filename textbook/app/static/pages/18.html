<h3>Collect Data</h3>
<p>Carry out your plan and record your data on a whiteboard. When you have collected your data, put it into the
    <a href="#" class="table" data-id="4">Table</a>.
        <a class="activity-button table" data-id="4" ></a></p>
<p>As a group, create a whiteboard to share with the rest of the class. It should include:
        <ul>
            <li>Data table</li>
            <li>Graph with units and labels</li>
            <li>The story of your car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know?</li>
        </ul>
</p>

<p>Take a screenshot of the whiteboard with your groupâ€™s data, and upload it to your gallery #4.
    <ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#" class="gallery" data-id="4" data-view="class" >Upload a Picture to your Gallery</a>
    </li>
</ul>
