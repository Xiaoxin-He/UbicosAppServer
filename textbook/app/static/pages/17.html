<h2>How Fast?</h2>
<h3>Plan to Collect Data</h3>
<p>Using the materials at hand, our task is to devise a method of determining how fast our car moves as confidently as possible. Let's create our class plan on a large whiteboard.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What measurements should we take?</li>
            <li>What units will we use?</li>
            <li>Do we plan to take more than one set of data?</li>
            <li>What procedures do we need to follow so that our data is as accurate and comparable as possible?</li>
        </ul>
<p>Create a table on your whiteboard to collect your data.</p>

<p>        Letâ€™s take a picture of our directions so you can reference them as you do the experiment. [add gallery]</p>
