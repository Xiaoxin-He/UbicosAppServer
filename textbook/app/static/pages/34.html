<h1>Cobi Needs your help Again!</h1>


<p>
    All week we have discussed how you explaining and discussing ideas with others not only helps them,
    but helps you understand the material better as well. Nowâ€™s your chance to practice your help-giving
    skills by teaching a computer agent how to solve ratio problems.


    If you need a reminder of how Cobi works, watch the Cobi Training Video [add the link]

    Use your workbook Pg. 23 through Pg. 28 to help teach Cobi how to solve the problems.
